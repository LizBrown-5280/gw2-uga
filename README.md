# gg2-uga

This is a Vue 3 project in Vite. Guild Wars 2 - Unoffical Game App is a learning project and may not ever be fully realized.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Vue - Official](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur & Volar).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

### Volar has been deprecated. Vue - Official has taken its place

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).

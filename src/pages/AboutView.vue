    <h1>About this site</h1>
    <p>
      I created this site as a place to work on my coding skills and thought it would be fun to work with Guild Wars 2
      Web API since I am a long time GW player. I have started to published pages for this site, but I just want to be
      clear that the GW2 section may never be fully realized. With that being said, the accuracy of the open data
      provided and data retrieved by use of a GW2 API key will be as accurate as the GW2 source iteself.

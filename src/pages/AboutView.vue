    <h1>About this site</h1>
    <p>
      I developed this site to enhance my Vue 3 coding skills and thought it would be exciting to incorporate the Guild Wars 2
      API, as I have been a long-time player of the game. While I have begun publishing pages for the site, I want to clarify that
      the GW2 section may not ever be fully completed. Nonetheless, the accuracy of the open data and the information obtained
      using a GW2 API key will reflect the reliability of the GW2 source itself.

    <p>My practices and policy about your data is that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This site does not currently utilize cookies on your device.</li>
      <li>If you choose to save your account keys, they will be stored in local storage on your device.</li>
      <li>Should I decide to store any data on the server in the future, I will inform you here.</li>
      <li>The only circumstance under which I would share your data is if compelled by a court order.</li>
      <li>
        I commit to never selling, trading, renting, or giving away any Guild Wars 2 API keys or data obtained through those keys.
